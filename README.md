# Caffeine

In this project, we take a look at a dataset which contains numerous different drinks with varying levels of caffeine. The goal of the project is to identify some healthier alternatives to the standard sugary energy and coffee drinks we all enjoy.

The project uses Pandas for data manipulation and filtering and Plotly for vizualization.

* a quick note - Plotly visuals wont show up directly in Github, but you can use the nbviewer at the following link to see the project thee if you dont want to load it outside of Github.
